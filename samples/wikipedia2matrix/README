This program assumes that the input files are created by WikiExtractor.py.
Files are recursively searched from the input directory.
The output file is alphabetically sorted dictionary, alphabetically sorted article name,
and sparse matrix.
Word ID is the row number of the dictionary (start from zero).
The format of the matrix is like pos:count pos:count ....
The n-th row corresponds to document whose article name is in n-th row of the article name.
The "pos" above corresponds to the word ID.
